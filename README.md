# KingSort

### This program alphabetically sorts an array of kings names, and in case they have the same names, they will be sorted by their roman number.

The approach taken was to go through all the given array list of names, separating the Roman Numbers and converting them do Arabic Numbers and them returning them to the respective name.
Then I ordered the list and after that returned the Arabic Numbers to their orginal Roman Numbers.

###### Order of progress:
1. Created the KingSort class.
2. Created a Helper to handle convertions to make the sort easier
    - For this part I had help from a few stackoverflow answers in converting Roman Numbers <-> Arabic Numbers
3. Created a console aplication, just to see if the sort was correct
